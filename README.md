# Subspace_Preserved_Compact_Tensor
The first folder is for the implementation of CTensor and the second folder is for the implementation of CTensor-AD. Their dependencies are: Tensor-Tensor Product Toolbox, see https://github.com/canyilu/tproduct.
Each folder corresponds to the proposed CTensor and CTensor-AD algorithm, and contains the demo file.
